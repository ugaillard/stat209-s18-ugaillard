## Instructions

Below you will find several empty R code scripts.
Your task is to fill in the required code snippets.

## Arbuthnot Births Dataset

Today we will be working with the Arbuthnot births dataset from the second week
of the semester (I kept this assignment short so that you can move onto the
project with the remaining time):

```{r}
births <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/stat_data/arbuthnot.csv")
```

## Making Numbers Categorical

Start by creating a scatter plot with year on the x-axis and total number 
of births on the y-axis. Color the points based on the number of girls that
were born in the that year:

```{r}
ggplot(births, aes(year, total)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = girls))
```

Now, convert `girls` to a factor using the `factor()` function. Notice how
the colors change:

```{r}
ggplot(births, aes(year, total)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(girls)))
```

Try instead to use the `bin` command to bin the girls variable:

```{r}
ggplot(births, aes(year, total)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = bin(girls, 5)))
```

Think about the differences between these three plots: numeric number of girls,
factor number of girls, and binned number of girls.

## Reordering Factors

Now, create a line plot with year on the x-axis and the total number of births
on the y-axis. Color the lines based on the head of state:

```{r}
ggplot(births, aes(year, total)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = head_of_state))
```

Now using `fct_inorder` to convert the ordering of the heads of state:

```{r}
ggplot(births, aes(year, total)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = fct_inorder(head_of_state)))
```

Notice that this is a better way to present the data (and something we
wanted to do back in week 2 but did not yet know how to do it).
