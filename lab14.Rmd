## Instructions

Below you will find several empty R code scripts.
Your task is to fill in the required code snippets.

## Birds Data Again

Today we will be working with the birds data once again (and as on
Thursday, hopefully allowing time to once again look at Project B):

```{r}
birds <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/stat_data/birds.csv")
```

Here is a full data dictionary describing all of the variables

- **genus** (chr): taxonomic rank of the bird
- **species** (chr): scientific species name of the bird
- **name** (chr): common name of the bird
- **type** (chr): common name of the type of bird
- **egg_mass** (dbl): average mass of an egg when laid (grams)
- **male_mass** (dbl): average observed mass of an adult male (grams)
- **mating_system** (int): scores of mating system. Intensity of male-male competition increases from 1 to 5.
    - (1) polyandry
    - (2) monogamy (<5% polygyny)
    - (3) mostly monogamy, but occasional polygyny (5â€“15% polygyny)
    - (4) mostly polygyny (> 15% polygyny)
    - (5) lek or promiscuous
- **display** (int): mating display agility
    - (1) ground displays only, including displays on trees and bushes
    - (2) ground displays, but with occasional jumps/leaps into the air
    - (3) both ground and non-acrobatic flight displays
    - (4) mainly aerial displays, non-acrobatic
    - (5) mainly aerial displays, acrobatic
- **resource** (int): scores of territoriality and between-mate resource sharing
    - (0) males and females don't share resources and they feed away from their breeding territory
    - (1) males and females share resources on their territory only during the breeding season
    - (2) males and females share resources on their territory all year round.
- **clutch_size** (dbl): average number of eggs produced per clutch

Notice that the last two variables are integer codes. They are stored as numbers but
correspond to a category.

## Summarizing the Data

Create a new dataset which summarizes everything to the level of a bird 
type using the `group_summarize` function:

```{r}
bird_level <- group_summarize(birds, type)
print(bird_level)
```

Create a log-log plot of the median egg mass and median male mass for each
bird type.

```{r}
ggplot(bird_level, aes(egg_mass_mean, male_mass_mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

Now create a new dataset filtered to only those bird types with 5 or more
birds in the original dataset:

```{r}
bird_type_5_or_more <- filter(bird_level, n >= 5)
print(bird_type_5_more)
```

Finally, add two layers to the first plot that (1) colors the smaller set 
of birds in red and (2) provides a textual label for the red colored points.
Try to make the labels readable (hint: perhaps add the `alpha` aesthetic
to the first set of points and/or jitter the y-axis of the labels):

```{r}
ggplot(bird_level, aes(egg_mass_mean, male_mass_mean)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_point(color = "salmon", data = bird_type_5_or_more, size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = type), data = bird_type_5_or_more)
```
